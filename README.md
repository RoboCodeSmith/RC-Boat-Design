# RC-Boat-Design
Literature survey and implementation of Naval engineering concepts for RC Boat Design speed and control optimization

Led and managed a team of 7 other people and worked into making a RC boat to represent Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) in Rowboatics Techfest , the RC boat competition in the technical fest of IIT Bombay . 

Please refer to the following pdfs uploaded to this repository for the details of the boats :
* https://github.com/ayush-agarwal-0502/RC-Boat-Design/blob/main/rowboatics%20RB-225396%20final%20abstract%20.pdf
* https://github.com/ayush-agarwal-0502/RC-Boat-Design/blob/main/RB-225844%20Rowboatics.pdf

Care has been taken to include discussion upon 
* __Structural Aspects__ such as Hull Types and parameters - focussing mainly upon Catamaran and Deep V hulls 
* __Physical Aspects__ such as Weight Balancing , Torque Balancing etc
* __Material Aspects__ covering material properties of used materials 
* __Braking System__ , both Hydraulic and Reverse Thrusting Based braking 
* __Propellor Design__ , including effect of Ducts and blade size , pitch , rake etc 
* __Hydrodynamic aspects__ and effects of special structures such as Vortex generators , Bubble Generators , Guides , Hydrofoils 
* __Electronics part__ , including choice of transmitter , receiver , ESC (Electronic Speed Control) and BLDC motors 

The CAD Models have also been uploaded in this repository for further reference of reader .
